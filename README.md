1. Context memory: Python: Use a database like SQLite or Redis to store conversation history. You can use the `sqlite3` module for SQLite or `redis-py` for Redis. Flutter: Use `shared_preferences` or `hive` package for local storage. Angular: Use Angular's built-in services and RxJS to manage state, or consider using NgRx for more complex state management.

Done. (Hooked up to SQLite)

2. Web search integration: Python: Use libraries like `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` for web scraping, or integrate with search APIs like Google Custom Search JSON API. Flutter: Use the `http` package to make API calls to search engines. Angular: Use Angular's `HttpClient` to make API calls to search services.

Done. (Hooked up to Google Search API)

3. Document analysis: Python: Use libraries like `PyPDF2` for PDFs, `python-docx` for Word documents, and `pandas` for spreadsheets. Flutter: Use plugins like `file_picker` and `pdf_text` for file handling and text extraction. Angular: Use libraries like `pdf.js` for client-side PDF parsing, or handle document processing on the server-side.

Done. (Hooked up to custom code that does analysis on word docs, excel / csv spreadsheets, pdf files.)

4. Voice interface: Python: Use `speech_recognition` for speech-to-text and `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech. Flutter: Use the `speech_to_text` and `flutter_tts` packages. Angular: Integrate with Web Speech API for both speech recognition and synthesis.
5. Personalization: Python: Use machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn` for user modeling. Flutter/Angular: Implement user preferences storage using local storage or server-side databases.
6. Task scheduling: Python: Use `APScheduler` for scheduling tasks. Flutter: Use the `flutter_local_notifications` package for local reminders. Angular: Use `ngx-scheduler` for a calendar interface, integrate with server-side scheduling.
7. Multi-modal input/output: Python: Use `Pillow` for image processing, `librosa` for audio, and `opencv-python` for video. Flutter: Use `image_picker` for images, `audioplayers` for audio, and `video_player` for video. Angular: Use built-in APIs like `FileReader` and HTML5 media elements, or libraries like `ng2-pdf-viewer` for PDFs.
8. API integrations: Python: Use `requests` library for HTTP requests to various APIs. Flutter/Angular: Use HTTP clients (`http` package in Flutter, `HttpClient` in Angular) to interact with APIs.
9. Language translation: Python: Use the `googletrans` library or integrate with professional translation APIs. Flutter: Use the `translator` package or cloud translation services. Angular: Integrate with translation services via HTTP requests.
10. Sentiment analysis: Python: Use natural language processing libraries like `NLTK` or `TextBlob`. Flutter/Angular: Implement sentiment analysis on the server-side and consume results in the frontend.
11. Customizable personas: This is more about design and content than specific technologies. Implement different response sets or behavior models in your backend logic.
12. Explainable AI: Python: Use libraries like `SHAP` or `LIME` for model interpretability. Flutter/Angular: Display explanations received from the backend.
13. Privacy controls: Implement this across all layers of your application, using secure storage methods and allowing users to manage their data.
14. Collaborative features: Python: Use websockets (`websockets` library) for real-time communication. Flutter: Use the `web_socket_channel` package. Angular: Use `Socket.IO` or Angular's `WebSocketSubject`.
15. Summarization: Python: Use NLP libraries like `spacy` or `gensim` for text summarization. Flutter/Angular: Send text to the backend for summarization and display results.
